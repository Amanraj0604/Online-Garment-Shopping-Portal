# Online Clothes Ordering System

This is an online clothes ordering system developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into three main folders:

### 1. shop-ui

This folder contains the frontend codebase built with React.js. It includes the user interface for browsing clothes, placing orders, and managing the shopping cart.

### 2. backend

The backend folder contains the server-side code written in Node.js and Express.js. It handles authentication, database interactions, and serves API endpoints for the frontend.

### 3. admin

The admin folder contains the backend interface for managing products, orders, and users. It provides functionalities for administrators to add/edit products, view orders, and manage user accounts.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: Database to store product information, user data, and orders.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for building RESTful APIs in Node.js.
- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **Bootstrap**: Frontend framework for responsive design and styling.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For user authentication and authorization.
